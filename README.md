# ALPR
This project develops an ALPR system that detects and extracts license plate information from vehicle images. Using the Marker-Controlled Watershed algorithm for segmentation and a feature-based approach for extraction, it ensures accurate recognition. The system is deployed as a web application for traffic monitoring.
